## Challenge - Fix my code

### Tasks

<details>
<summary>0. Server status</summary>

I've recently initiated a new Flask project, and the initial aspect I'm establishing is a route for my API's status, which is crucial for a load balancer setup. However, I'm encountering issues with its functionality.

Could you please take a look at it and resolve the problem?

You can find my code [here](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge/tree/master/status_server/)

```shell
$ python -m api.v1.app 
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
....
```

```shell
$ curl -XGET http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/status
{
  "error": "Not found"
}
$
```

<summary>1. My square</summary>

I have a passion for geometry!

Take a look at [my square](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge/blob/master/square.py). Is it perfect? If not, should I make any adjustments?

<summary>2. Step 2: User model</summary>

I've encountered a significant issue!

I've just initiated my OOP project, and nothing seems to be functioning as expected. Could you please assist me? You can find my code [here](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge/blob/master/user.py).

<summary>3. Blog access</summary>

I've completed and deployed my Rails blog, but I'm receiving messages from people who can't access any of my blog posts. It's strange because it works fine for me.

Could you please take a look at it and resolve the issue? You can find my code base [here](https://chat.openai.com/c/link).

Additionally, once you've addressed the access problem, could you add a new feature for me?

I would like to introduce a boolean attribute named `online` for each `Post` object, with a default value of `true`. With this boolean, I intend to hide/show certain blog posts from the listing. I will also need a method to modify this boolean within the `Post#edit` route. Could you implement this for me?

<summary>4. Never leave the office</summary>


I just returned from a 2-week holiday in France, and upon arriving at the office, my marketing co-worker greeted me with, "Hi, how was your holiday? By the way, I think I broke the website..."

What???

Alright, let's dive into it and get [it](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge/tree/master/react-blog) fixed!

Oh, and I also have pagination to address. I didn't have the time to look into it before my break...
